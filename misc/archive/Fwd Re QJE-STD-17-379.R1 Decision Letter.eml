                                <span>Dear Janine,</span><br>
                                <span></span><br>
                                <span>I'm afraid it took quite a while
                                  to get a complete set of reviews, but
                                  I was keen to get the views of the
                                  original two reviewers and it was
                                  worth waiting for these. Thank you for
                                  your hard work in crafting this
                                  revised manuscript. Both reviewers and
                                  I appreciated the new analyses that
                                  tests 4 different priors. However, the
                                  reviewers also raise issues with this
                                  approach.</span><br>
                                <span></span><br>
                                <span>Reviewer 2 suggests a potentially
                                  a more parsimonious approach, which
                                  would be simply to fit the priors and
                                  avoid classifying the subjects into
                                  what is by now quite a large number of
                                  discrete categories. Reviewer 3
                                  (previously Reviewer 1) also raises
                                  the concern that your current approach
                                  means that you end up with very few
                                  subjects in the various cells, which
                                  makes it difficult to draw firm
                                  inferences (as you acknowledge
                                  yourself). This reviewer suggests that
                                  perhaps combining the data from both
                                  studies might help here. These points
                                  in particular will need to be
                                  addressed in a revision, but please do
                                  also respond to the other issues
                                  flagged up by the reviewers.</span><br>
                                <span></span><br>
                                <span>I've classed this as a 'major
                                  revision', mainly because I think you
                                  may need to do some further modelling
                                  work. I don't have a good sense of how
                                  long this will take you (if this
                                  approach is feasible), so in this way
                                  the time frame is relatively generous.</span><br>

                                <span>Comments to the Author</span><br>
                                <span>I reviewed the original MS as
                                  Reviewer 2. I still think this is a
                                  well-written manuscript (apart from
                                  the statement that there is an effect
                                  on confidence when there isn’t, p.
                                  23). The actual changes to the MS are
                                  mostly related to fitting three more
                                  Bayesian prior models and adding some
                                  references. The authors have managed
                                  to side-step many of my comments by
                                  the way they choose to address the
                                  comment on priors. Although I
                                  appreciate that they have fit many
                                  more models, the selection of models
                                  feels somewhat post-hoc and arbitrary
                                  – especially given the authors
                                  favoured approach of classifying
                                  participants as belonging to one model
                                  or another. I believe the authors
                                  should discuss fitting priors (rather
                                  than assuming that people have N
                                  different well defined unique priors),
                                  and if possible implement such fits.</span><br>

                                <span></span><br>
                                <span>Presumably, the authors found that
                                  some participants appeared to have
                                  decreasing and increasing valuations
                                  with sample size and therefore
                                  included the loss and the gain model.
                                  However, the authors now attempt to
                                  classify 40 subjects into 6 different
                                  categories (incl baseline) –– and then
                                  also try to infer population-level
                                  parameters (mean valuation) from
                                  sub-classes with potentially very low
                                  N. The authors acknowledge that this
                                  is a potential issue, but the reader
                                  is left wondering why this approach
                                  was taken in the first place?</span><br>

                                <span>Why not infer (i.e., fit) the
                                  prior? This would entirely side-step
                                  the issue of having to decide that N
                                  participants are best fit by this or
                                  that model. The authors would get one
                                  likelihood for the Bayesian model and
                                  one for the frequentist model for each
                                  participant – where the Bayesian
                                  model’s parameters would vary across
                                  participants (and that variation – the
                                  distribution of parameters – could be
                                  inspected for quantification of prior
                                  beliefs across those best fit by the
                                  Bayesian model). And if the data does
                                  not provide sufficient constraints for
                                  fitting the prior (it may well not) –
                                  the authors ought to justify the
                                  chosen ones (perhaps quantitatively -
                                  does using N categories provide a
                                  better overall model fit [accounting
                                  for N] than using N-1 categories). </span><br>

                                  a cat, ideally the same cat. I wasn’t
                                  trying to make the point that your
                                  model needs to be the identical cat –
                                  only that your model of a cat appears
                                  to have 5 legs (occasionally) and that

                                  outlined in my first review, and you
                                  did not address this at all (though I
                                  agree that for many subjects the

                                <span>P 23 – the authors say that they
                                  find that confidence depends on sample
                                  size for Bayesian learners, yet the
                                  stats they report previously favour a

                                  it’s a typo. </span><br>

                                <span>Figure 2 is a nice attempt at
                                  showing individual model fits clearly
                                  – but it’s rather difficult to
                                  interpret. What do the different
                                  shades represent. Presumably BFs? But
                                  what does very strong etc map onto -
                                  describing the BF cut-offs would be
                                  useful (there are different
                                  conventions). Also, key features are
                                  missing – what is the model support
                                  expressed relative to? Presumably not
                                  the base-line model? To the next
                                  best-fitting model? IF so, it’s
                                  crucial for interpreting the plot to
                                  know which the second best-fit model
                                  was (e.g., it matters whether the

                                  models is actually the frequency
                                  model, or whether the next best
                                  fitting BF model for the gain prior is
                                  the loss priors). &nbsp;</span><br>

                                <span>The authors should be commended

                                  surprising that the Prelec weighting
                                  function did not improve fits relative
                                  to models without it. The authors may
                                  want to include a footnote to this
                                  effect as I’m sure other readers would
                                  also find this useful information.

                                <span>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the questions I
                                  wondered after reading the revised
                                  paper, “The influence of sample size
                                  on preferences from experience”, is:
                                  what is the main goal? According to
                                  the beginning of the General
                                  Discussion, “The main goal of these
                                  studies was to investigate how people
                                  form preferences from experience by
                                  comparing gamble valuations after
                                  having observed different numbers of
                                  outcomes, that is, after encountering
                                  different sample sizes”. That sounds
                                  right to me. However, the abstract
                                  claims that the goal of the research
                                  is to “understand why people rely on
                                  small samples”. That seems less right
                                  to me. I think the research highlights
                                  a new potential explanation for why
                                  people rely on small samples but does
                                  not go far enough to directly test it.
                                  I suggest the researchers be more
                                  careful with their language, or
                                  conduct a new study along the lines
                                  that I suggested in the initial review
                                  (i.e., Comment 19, where the
                                  categorization is used to predict
                                  behaviour in a free sampling
                                  paradigm). </span><br>
                                <span>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;The new analysis, which
                                  inspired Figures 2, 4, 5 and 7, is
                                  great. I suggest the researchers
                                  expand on the logic. For example, the
                                  sentence, “Second, depending on the
                                  prior belief, the BVU model predicts
                                  either a decrease or an increase in
                                  valuations with growing sample size”
                                  (pg 19), or earlier. However, the
                                  sample size is problematic when the
                                  data are spliced like this. The
                                  researchers acknowledge this on page
                                  20 and elsewhere. Is acknowledgment
                                  enough? Does something more need to be
                                  done to increase the level of
                                  validity? The researchers appear
                                  reluctant to collect new data (in the
                                  form of a new experiment, or new
                                  participants added to the existing
                                  studies). Is there some reason why the
                                  researchers could not combined Study 1
                                  and 2 into one big dataset and run a
                                  single analysis with Experiment # as a
                                  moderator variable? </span><br>

                                <span>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;I like figure 1 a lot. It
                                  really helps the reader follow the
                                  argument. </span><br>
                                <span>4. &nbsp; &nbsp;Page 9 typo: “As as third,
                                  subordinate goal we sought to clearly
                                  … ”.</span><br>
                                <span>5. &nbsp; &nbsp;Page 10: “Participants
                                  valued each gamble three times in each
                                  sample-size category and hence 12
                                  times in total”. Why isn’t this 18
                                  times in total? Earlier it says,
                                  “Participants repeatedly valued the
                                  same six gambles”. Six multiplied by
                                  three is 18. What am I missing? In
                                  general, I still find the methods
                                  section to be very hard to follow. I
                                  suggest the researchers include a new
                                  figure that shows the flow of the
                                  participant through the study.</span><br>
                                <span>6. &nbsp; &nbsp;Page 11: From what I can
                                  tell, the researchers throw away half
                                  of their data for problems of “high
                                  gain, high probability” and “low gain,
                                  low probability”. What is the
                                  justification for this? Couldn’t this
                                  data be usefully incorporated in the
                                  modelling exercise somehow? </span><br>
                                <span>7. &nbsp; &nbsp;Figure 3: “Participants for
                                  whom even the better fitting model
                                  qualitatively seem to not capture the
                                  data pattern well are marked with an
                                  x. BVU”. I looked long and hard before
                                  finding the “X”. Could you help the
                                  reader somehow?</span><br>
