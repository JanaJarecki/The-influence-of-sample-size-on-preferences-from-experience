These results illustrate the variability in how people learn from sampled information and provide an explanation for why sample size often does not affect judgments.

\maketitle

In everyday life, people often form preferences on the basis of past experiences. The strength of these preferences arguably depends on the amount of previous experience. Someone who has visited a restaurant for many years and has always had positive experiences likely has a stronger positive preference for this restaurant than someone who visited the restaurant only once and had a positive experience. Thus, even if the relative frequency of positive experiences is similar, the strength of preferences can differ depending on the amount of experience. We examined how people's preferences in an experience-based judgment situation under risk evolve as a function of growing experience. 

%In everyday life people often base their preferences on past experiences. How much experience people have made with an option arguably influences how strong people's opinion about this option is. Someone who had made 50 out of 50 good experiences with a restaurant probably has a stronger preference for this restaurant than someone who had made 1 out of 1 good experience with this restaurant although the relative frequency of good experiences is the same in both situations. Here, we study, how people's preferences (i.e. valuations) in an experience-based task evolve as a function of growing experience. 

\section{Search Effort in Experience-Based Tasks and the Description-Experience Gap (D--E gap) and }
\added[id=jj]{Search effort refers to the amount of samples that people draw in experience-based risky choice tasks. In experience-based tasks \citep[e.g.,][]{Hertwig2004, Hau2008}, people learn about the distribution of outcomes of gambles by repeatedly drawing samples from a gamble until they feel confident to make a judgment or decision. By contrast, in description-based tasks, people judge risky gambles from numerical, graphical, or textual summaries of the gambles' outcome distributions. Past research found that risk preferences differ between description- and experience- and description-based tasks (the decision-experience gap or D--E gap=. In decisions from description, people choose as if they overweight rare events \citep{Kahneman1979}, in decisions from experience, they choose as if they underweight rare events \citep{Hertwig2004}.}

The size of the sample that people draw (search effort) in experience-based tasks plays a key role in explaining the D--E gap, because smaller samples cause higher sampling error. Sampling error means that the observed outcome sequence deviates from the objective outcome probabilities \citep{Hadar2009}. Drawing larger samples diminishes the sampling error, but usually the samples drawn are not sufficient to allow inferences about the true distribution of a skewed gamble. Participants in \cite{Hertwig2004}, for instance, drew small samples (median of 15 samples per decision), and with this number of samples, the skew of a two-outcome gamble's binomial sampling distribution implies that more people undersample than oversample  low-probability outcomes (rare events). Indeed, averaged across trials, in Hertwig et al.'s study, the rare event was undersampled by $78\%$ of the participants. Other studies have reported similar sampling errors \citep[e.g.,][]{Hau2008,Rakow2008}. Explanations for why people often search insufficiently include limits of memory, opportunity costs \citep{Hau2008}, or adaptive choice simplification \citep{Hertwig2010}: Simulations have shown that small samples amplify the differences between the observed means of the outcome distributions of risky options.

\added[id=jj]{Previous work tried to eliminate sampling error in experienced-based risky choice in order to understand the D--E gap.} Attempts have involved encouraging participants to draw larger samples \citep{Hau2008}, showing samples that represent the gambles' true probability distributions \citep{Ungemach2009}, showing large numbers of random samples \citep{Hau2008,Hau2010}, describing gambles to match the outcome distribution sampled by other participants  \citep{Rakow2008}, and only analyzing trials in which the drawn sample approximates the gambles' true outcome distribution \citep[e.g.,][]{Camilleri2009, Camilleri2011a}. Sometimes the D--E gap diminished \citep{Hau2008,Hau2010, Ungemach2009} or vanished \citep{Gloeckner2012, Camilleri2009,Camilleri2011a,Rakow2008}, but despite these mixed findings, the D--E gap is a robust phenomenon \citep[for a recent meta-analysis, see][]{Wulff2017}. \added[id=jj]{Most of this research focused on sampling error which is merely a by-product of small sample sizes.}

\added[id=jj]{In the present work we examine the role of sample size in experience-based preference formation. To do so, we manipulated how many samples people could draw from the prospects' outcome distributions (sample size) and measured people's preferences (i.e., selling prices). Aiming to isolate the effects of sample size on preferences, our design eliminated sampling error. Thus, we study  whether sample size influences preferences independently of sampling error.}


%While the question whether people process information from description differently than information from experience is definitely interesting, here . Instead we will focus on how sample size influences how risky prospects are evaluated. To do so, we manipulate how many samples people can draw from the prospects' outcome distributions and study

\section{How Does Sample Size Influence Preferences?}
The question of how sample size influences judgments has interested psychologists for decades \citep[e.g.,][]{Tversky1971, Griffin1992}. We investigated how sample size influences preferences from experience, contrasting two theories: \textit{the belief in the law of small numbers} \citep{Tversky1971} and \textit{Bayesian updating}. 

The belief in the law of small numbers, which was formulated by \cite{Tversky1971}, is the belief that it is highly probable that a small sequences of random draws represents the true outcome distribution. When asked to mentally produce a short sequence of random coin tosses, people produced sequences with a relative frequency of heads and tails of $.50$ more often than statistically expected \citep{Tversky1971}. In \cite{Griffin1992}, participants ignored sample size in their judgments of coin biases after seeing sequences of coin tosses of different length, some of which were biased. Participants based their estimates of the probabilities associated with the coins mostly on the observed relative frequency of head and tail outcomes. Surprisingly, participants expressed higher confidence in their judgments when the number of coin tosses was small, \added[id=jj]{whereas from a statistical perspective, confidence should be lower for smaller samples.} Several studies have found that people's inferential \citep[e.g.,][]{Kutzner2016}, perceptual \citep[e.g.,][]{Kvam2016}, and preferential judgments \citep[e.g.,][]{Powell2017} are less sensitive to sample sizes than expected by normative models.

In contrast to the belief in the law of small numbers, Bayesian psychological principles suggest that not only the relative frequency of outcomes but also sample size influences judgments. The Bayesian view offers a normative solution to how people deal with sample sizes. People can treat sample size as a measure of uncertainty, knowing that small samples can lead to a biased representation of the true outcome distribution and larger samples to a more veridical description of the true outcome distribution, and there is some evidence that people treat sample size as a measure of uncertainty, for instance, when they report preferences for consumer goods \citep{DeMartino2017}, make judgments about group differences \citep{Obrecht2010}, or student performance \citep{Fiedler2002}.

\subsection{Cognitive Models and Hypothesis}
To contrast the Bayesian principles with the belief in the law of small numbers in experience-based probability learning we specified two computational learning models. Before introducing the models, it is crucial to recognize that our experimental methods employ predefined sample sizes and representative sequences. In our experiments, participants sampled a \textit{predefined} number of times from a gamble's outcome distribution and evaluated it by indication of the gamble's selling price. Gambles were two-outcome gamble characterized by a gain and a zero-outcome. Individual gambles were presented with different sample sizes and these sample sequences were \textit{representative} of the gamble's true outcome distribution, which allowed us to isolate the effect of sample size without sampling error. For this task---one gain $g$ and one zero-outcome---the models were formalized as learning the probability of the nonzero gain outcome (extending the models for cases with different outcomes is possible).

We follow an expected utility approach \added[id=jj]{and represent preferences about risky options by subjective utility functions; the subjective value of a risky option $V$ is the sum of the subjective utilities of the outcomes weighted by the outcome probabilities. We used a power utility, $u(g) = g^{\mathrm{\alpha}}$, where $g$ is the gain outcome and $\alpha$ is a free parameter. The resulting expected utility is then converted back to the monetary scale. When outcome probabilities must be learned, which is the case in experience-based decision making, true probabilities are replaced by the decision makers' beliefs ($B$)  about outcome probabilities and the predicted valuation given the learning model $m$ after seeing sample number $t$ is given by }

$$V_{\mathrm{m}, t} = \sqrt[\mathrm{\alpha}]{{B}_{\mathrm{m}, t} \times u({g})}$$where $m \in$ RF, BVU denotes the Bayesian updating and the relative frequency model (respectively). The two models differ with regard to how people form beliefs $B$ about the outcome probabilities.

\subsubsection{Relative frequency model}

\added[id=jj]{The \textit{relative frequency model (RF)} forms beliefs about probabilities from relative frequencies. It formalizes how people, who trust in the law of small numbers, estimate probabilities.} This model predicts that after sampling $t$ times the belief about the probability of a gain corresponds to the observed relative frequencies of gains
$${B}_{\mathrm{RF}, t}  =  \frac{n_t}{t} ,$$
\added[id=jj]{where $n_t$ represents the number of gains observed until sample number $t$ (including $t$).}

\added[id=jj]{The relative frequency model suggests that changes in sample size do not change the resulting valuations unless the sample size changes the observed relative frequencies. The relative frequency model does not incorporate prior beliefs about the probabilities of the outcomes.}

\subsubsection{Bayesian value updating model}
The \emph{Bayesian value updating (BVU)} model implements a Bayesian perspective on probability learning and the resulting uncertainty from sampling. \added[id=jj]{According to Bayesian principles people form beliefs about probabilities based on the observed frequencies of gains and prior beliefs about outcome probabilities. The Bayesian model formalizes the beliefs about gain probabilities by a beta distribution ${B}_{\mathrm{BVU}} \sim Beta(a,b)$ \cite[for an introduction to Bayesian cognitive models, see][]{Griffiths2008a}. Initially (at $t = 0$) beliefs are represented by a prior belief distribution $B_{\mathrm{BVU},0} \sim Beta(\theta_G$, $\theta_0)$, with person-specific parameters $\theta$. The prior belief is updated from the sampled number of gains and zero-outcomes; the updated beliefs after the $t$th sample follow the distribution}

$$B_{\mathrm{BVU},t} \sim Beta(\theta_G + \delta n_t, \theta_0 + \delta (t-n_t))$$,

\added[id=jj]{where  $\delta$ is a learning rate to account for individual differences in conservatism \citep{Edwards1967,Tauber2017}; the values $n_t$ is the counts of gain outcomes after sample $t$; parameter $\theta_G$, $\theta_0$ are the shape parameter of the prior Beta distribution for gains and zero-outcomes, respectively. The point estimate for the updated belief about the gain probability equals the posterior mean of this distribution, ${B}_\mathrm{BVU, t} = \frac{C}{C + D}$, with $C = \theta_G + \delta b_t$ and $D=\theta_0 + \delta m_t$.}

The learning process of the Bayesian (BVU) model's is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:sensi}\added[id=jj]{, showing the model's beliefs about the probability of a gain as a function of the number of samples that were drawn and the initial beliefs about the gain probability. The orange curves show different initial beliefs, the purple and black curve illustrate the change in belief after observing a small representative sample of outcomes (\textit{t}$=$5) and a large representative sample (\textit{t}$=$30). The beliefs after observing the large sample approximate the true probability of the gamble, independently of the prior belief. For small samples, however, the prior belief impacts the models' posterior belief about the gamble's gain probability (purple curve). Unlike the Bayesian model, the relative frequency model predicts a constant probability $Pr(\text{gain})$ equal to the true $Pr(\text{gain})$after having seen a representative sequence of outcomes, such as 1 in 5 gains or 6 in 30 gains.}

\end{figure}

The BVU model predicts that sample size and the prior influence valuations. This is because as sample size increases, the beta-distributed belief shifts from the mean of the prior belief in the direction of the true underlying probability of the gain  (see Figure \ref{fig:sensi}). Whether the model predicts a decrease or an increase in valuations with growing sample size depends on the shape of the prior belief and the true gain probability. For true gain probabilities lower than 50\% and a uniform prior belief or a prior belief peaked over highly probable gains, the valuations should decrease as a function of sample size, according to the BVU model. If the prior is peaked over losses, however, the BVU model predicts that valuations increase as a function of sample size. For gain probabilities  larger than 50\% and uniform or loss-priors valuations should increase with sample size, and decrease for priors peaked over gains. In all cases, the probability belief gets increasingly peaked around the true probability of the gain as sample size grows. Therefore, the model also predicts that confidence in valuations increases with increasing sample size. %We also test this prediction by assessing confidence ratings.

Following \cite{Griffin1992}, we also asked participants for their confidence in their valuations. We tested whether people would be more confident about their responses when the sample size was small, as found by \cite{Griffin1992}. 

\section{Study 1}
Our experimental methods had two main and one subordinate goals. We aimed to measure peoples' preference strength for risky prospects, and therefore, we prompted participants to evaluate individual gambles in line with recent work \citep[e.g.,][]{Ashby2014, Golan2014, Pachur2012}, because evaluations allow us to measure preference strength more precisely than binary choices. This is important, as detecting subtle differences in strength of preference requires fine-grained measurement scales. Second, we aimed to lay bare the precise effects of sample size---therefore, we presented each gamble with various sample sizes. \added[id=jj]{We presented representative samples, which eliminates sampling error and allows} for an unbiased comparison of the effects of sample sizes. However, the order of outcomes within a sampling sequence was random. \added[id=jj]{A third, but sub-ordinate, goal was comparing valuations from experience with valuations from description.} Therefore, we added a block where people made valuations from description. However, as our main goals involved studying how preferences change as a function of sample size, we refrained from manipulating the order of the experience and description blocks. Instead, all people made valuations first from experience and afterward in a separate block from description. 

In Study 1, we examined how people form valuations from experience when they know the possible outcomes before they start sampling. In a situation where the outcomes are known, learning is simplified because participants only need to learn the outcome probabilities from experience. 

\subsection{Method}
\subsubsection{Participants}
Forty people (31 women, 9 men) from the participant pool of the University of Basel between 18 and 40 years old ($M = 23.41$ years, $SD = 4.86$) participated in the study. Participants could choose between a show-up fee of 10 CHF (approximately \$11.10 at the time of the experiment) or course credit. Additionally, each participant received a bonus payment that depended on the outcome of a randomly selected trial ($M = \$6.38$, $SD = \$7.62$).

\subsubsection{Stimuli and Design}
\added[id=jj]{The design was a within-subject design, participants evaluated two-outcome gambles from experience and from description. Six gambles wtih a gain or zero outcome were created by crossing two gamble types (\textit{\$-bet}, \textit{p-bet}) with three expected values (2.00, 3.20, 4.00), see Table \ref{table:Lotteries}. Three gambles offered a high gain with low probability (\$-bet), and three offered a small gain with high probability (p-bet, notation following \citealp{Lichtenstein1971}). In the experience-based valuation each gamble was crossed with four sample sizes: extra small, small, medium, large (xs, s, m, l, respectively), which are listed in Table \ref{table:Lotteries}. The extra small size (xs) consisted of 5, 6, or 7 samples, which allowed us to represent rare events of 1/5, 1/6, and 1/7 (20\%,  17\%, 14\%, respectively). The small sample size equaled xs $\times$ 2, medium equaled xs $\times$ 3, and large equaled xs $\times$ 6. Participants saw each gamble with each sample-sizes three times in fully randomized order (each gamble was seen 12 times).} %For illustration of the different sample sizes, consider Gamble 1 in Table~\ref{table:Lotteries}. It is a \$-bet that offers a gain of 16 with a probability of 1/5 (20\%). The different sample-size categories for this gamble are xs (five observations, one gain), s (ten observations, two gains), m (15 observations, three gains), and l (30 observations, six gains).}

\added[id=jj]{To avoid memory effects between trials, 18 filler trials were shown, that involved six gambles with outcomes identical to Table~\ref{table:Lotteries}, but probabilities changed to 75\% (\$-bets) and 25\% (p-bets). The filler gambles' sample sizes were 4, 8, and 16. Filler trials were excluded from analyses, because they only aimed at minimizing memory-effects.}

\subsubsection{Procedure}
Participants read printed instructions and completed a questionnaire that ensured their understanding of the instructions; the experimental task was computerized. \added[id=jj]{Participants judged the value of risky gambles (see Table~\ref{table:Lotteries}) and rated the confidence in their judgments. Gambles were judged one-by-one, in an experience-based format given different sample sizes, followed by a description format. In the experience format, participants were informed about the outcomes but not the probabilities of a gamble, which they learned by repeatedly sampling outcomes. The possible outcomes were represented by numbers in a circle (gains were in a black circle, zero-outcomes white) and stayed on screen throughout sampling. Pressing the space bar sampled an outcome; the realized outcome appeared as a black or white circle for 250 ms; sampling ended after a predefined sample size (listed in Table~\ref{table:Lotteries}). Participants were informed a priori about the pre-specification of the sample size. The sampled outcomes were representative for the gambles (i.e., drawing a sample of size 5 from a gamble with $Pr(\text{gain})=20\%$) yielded 1 gain and 4 zeros). After sampling, participants judged the gamble and reported confidence, and proceeded to the next trial. Sample size changed from trial to trial. } The trial order and outcome sequence within a trial was randomized for individual participants. \deleted[id=jj]{After participants had drawn the required number of outcomes, they were prompted for (1) their valuation of the gamble (see below) and (2) their confidence in their valuation} 

Confidence was measured on a 7-point Likert scale (from 0 = \textit{very unconfident} to 6 = \textit{very confident}). Valuations of gambles were measured as selling prices following the Becker--DeGroot--Marschak (BDM) method \citep{Becker1964}: \deleted[id=jj]{For each gamble}Participants stated their selling prices in terms of the lowest monetary amount for which they would give up the right to gamble. Prices could range from 0.00 to the current gain in CHF, with increments of 0.10 CHF. The BDM auction was incentivized as follows. The selling price that a participant entered was compared to a random value drawn from all possible selling prices in the trial. If this random number was larger than the stated selling price, the participant ``sold'' the gamble and received a monetary amount \replaced[id=jj]{that equaled}{equal to} the random number. If the random number was equal to or smaller than the selling price, the participant got to gamble. For the BDM, the optimal strategy is always to report the true selling price.\footnote{\label{logic.BDM} 
To understand this logic, consider the following example: A person has a true selling price for a given gamble of \$3. If this person sets her selling price too low (e.g., \$2) and the randomly generated number is \$2.10, she sells her gamble for a lower price than her true selling price. If, however, she sets her selling price too high (e.g., \$5) and the randomly generated number is \$4, she keeps and plays her gamble, although she actually would have preferred to receive the \$4.
} Detailed instructions as well as an example of the BDM auction were presented to explain the auction's mechanism. We used a short questionnaire to ensure that all participants had understood how the auction worked.

\subsection{Results}
\added[id=jj]{All analyses were conducted in the statistical programming environment R version 6.0.1 \citep{R}; linear modeling was conducted with he bmrs package version 2.10 \citep{Burkner2018} using weakly or non-informative priors;
%s were compared using the BayesFactor package version 0.9.12 \citep{BayesFactor};
inferences were based on the Bayes factor ($BF\textsubscript{ij}$).}\footnote{Bayes factors quantifiy how much more or less likely the data are under Model i ($\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{i}$) than Model j ($\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{j}$). A Bayes factor of 1 ($BF\textsubscript{ij} = 1$) means that the data do not discriminate between the two models $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{i}$ and $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{j}$. A Bayes factor of 5 (i.e., $BF\textsubscript{ij} = 5$) means that the data are 5 times more likely under $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{i}$ than under $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{j}$. A Bayes factor of $1/5$ ($BF\textsubscript{ij} = 1/5$) means that the data are 5 times more likely under $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{j}$ (note that $BF\textsubscript{ji} = 1/BF\textsubscript{ij}$).} 

\input{analyses/reports/results_study1}

%Table \ref{table:meansStudy2} displays the mean and median valuations from experience, that is, the monetary amount elicited with the BDM method, separately for each gamble and each sample-size category. The data suggest that sample size does not affect valuations from experience consistently. A model comparison supports this indication. Model $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{0}$, which predicts valuations from experience as a function of the random factor expected value and the fixed factor gamble type (p-bet vs. \$-bet), is preferred over a model that takes into account sample size as an additional fixed factor ($BF\textsubscript{01} = 409$) and a model that additionally takes into account the interaction between sample size and gamble type ($BF\textsubscript{01} > 1,000$).

%\subsubsection{Modeling procedure}
%To study the role of sample size more closely, we examined how well the RF model and the BVU model modeled participants' valuations in the experience condition. To test the psychological plausibility of both models, we also compared them to a baseline model. This baseline model predicts random responses, where each response between 0 and the gain amount is equally likely. 


%Before estimation, we rescaled both the observed and the model-predicted valuations by dividing them by the possible gain of the gamble in a trial. Consequently, all data points lay in the interval between 0 and 1. All models were estimated by applying maximum likelihood methods to participants' individual data. To compute the likelihood, we assumed that observed valuations followed a truncated normal distribution around the model's predicted valuation with a standard deviation that was estimated as a free parameter for each participant. Thus, the RF and BVU models, but not the baseline model, were equipped with one additional free standard deviation parameter. We searched for the set of parameter values that minimized the deviance, defined as the negative log likelihood of the data given the model and its parameter values. To identify the best model parameters, we used a brute-force grid-search approach. We searched the parameter space for the utility parameter $\upalpha$ between $0$ and $3$ in steps of $0.025$ and for the standard deviation of the truncated normal distribution between $0.00001$ and $0.3$ in steps of $0.01$. We compared the models on Bayesian model weights that we computed from the Bayesian information criterion (\citealp{Kass1995, Lewandowsky2011}).

%   \label{fig:modeling1}
% \end{figure}
% Figure \ref{fig:modeling1} displays the relative evidence for each of the models. It shows for how many participants ($x$ axis) each model is favored and how strong this evidence is (grayscale). 

%\textcolor{blue}{The data of 26 participants (65\%) were best described by the BVU model. Of these, 10 participants were best described with a uniform prior belief, 4 participants were best described with a bimodal prior belief, 4 participants were best described with a prior belief peaked over large gain probabilities (gain prior), and 8 participants were best described with a prior belief peaked over very low gain probabilities (loss prior). The evidence for individual participants is predominantly not very strong. An explanation for this finding is that for some trials, also a different prior belief could have described the data relatively well. If we only include the BVU model with the best fitting prior belief in the model comparison, the evidence strength is for 11 of the 26 participants very strong; for 6 of the 26 participants strong; for 6 of the 26 participants positive; and only for 3 of the 26 participants weak. For 12 participants (30\%), the RF model performed best. The data of 2 participants (5\%) were fit best by the baseline model.}

Participants for whom even the better fitting model qualitatively seem to not capture the data pattern well are marked with an x. BVU = Bayesian value updating; RF = relative frequency.}
%   \label{fig:ind.fits1}
% \end{figure}

% Next, we further explored the data using the results of the quantitative model comparison. For this purpose, we plotted individual valuations against the predictions made by the best fitting model separately for every participant given the optimal parameter estimates for that participant. This plot gives an indication of whether the models qualitatively capture data patterns. Figure \ref{fig:ind.fits1} shows that the models generally capture the data well. However, inspecting the figure reveals that in some cases, even the better fitting model does not capture the data patterns well. More precisely, this holds for four participants (marked with an x in Figure \ref{fig:ind.fits1}). For these participants the model is rejected because of the lack of qualitative fit.
% \added{The cognitive modeling results help to understand the null finding---that sample size has no effect on valuations---that we observed at the aggregate level. First, the aggregate analysis fails to take the heterogeneity in strategy use into account. Secondly, the aggregate analysis fails to account for prior beliefs about gain probabilities.}
% \textcolor{blue}{Depending on the prior belief, the BVU model predicts either a decrease or an increase in valuations with growing sample size.}


%Therefore, we next qualitatively investigated how the valuations of frequentist and Bayesian learners differ. We expected an effect of sample size only for Bayesian and not for frequentist learners. \textcolor{blue}{Separately for \$-bets and p-bets, we split Bayesian learners into two groups: For \$-bets, in one group we put those people who were best described by a model with a uniform prior, a bimodal prior, or a prior peaked over high gain probabilities. For these people, we expected a decrease in valuations with growing sample size. In the second group, we put those people who were best described by a model with a prior peaked over low gain probabilities. For these people, we expected an increase in valuations with growing sample size. For p-bets, in one group we put people who were best described by a model with a uniform prior, a bimodal prior, or a prior peaked over low gain probabilities. For these people, we expected an increase in valuations with growing sample size. In the second group, we put those people who were best described with a prior peaked over high gain probabilities. For these people, we expected a decrease in valuations with growing sample size.}  
% Figure \ref{fig:qual1} shows the mean ratings for \$-bets and p-bets separately for participants quantitatively and qualitatively best described by either the BVU \textcolor{blue}{split into two groups as described above} or the RF model. The figure shows that the mean valuations of Bayesian learners indeed differed from the mean valuations of frequentist learners: The mean valuations of Bayesian learners \textcolor{blue}{changed as a function of sample size for both \$-bets and p-bets. Depending on whether the model suggested an increase or a decrease in valuations, people's valuations increased or decreased.
% Yet, when we further statistically investigated this result only the increase in valuations of Bayesian learners for p-bets was reliable ($BF\textsubscript{10} > 1,000$, both $BF\textsubscript{10} < 1$ for \$-bets). Admittedly, the lack of statistical support for changes in valuations for Bayesian learners and \$-bets may have been the result of splitting Bayesian learners into two groups depending on whether the model predicts an increase or a decrease in valuations. For \$-bets, this procedure leads to a small \textit{N} (increasing = 8 and decreasing = 14) and hence very low statistical power. The mean valuations of frequentist learners did not show consistent variation (both gamble types $BF\textsubscript{10} < 1$).}

%   \label{fig:qual1}
% % \end{figure}

% \subsubsection{Effect of gamble type and sampling order}
% The mean and median ratings in Table \ref{table:meansStudy2} show that valuations for \$-bets (Gamble IDs 1--3) were higher than for p-bets (Gamble IDs 4--6), despite the gambles having the same expected value. This finding is supported by comparing a linear Bayesian regression model of gamble valuations $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{0}$ \added[id=jj]{that includes the expected value as random effect} with a model $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{1}$ \added[id=jj]{that includes p-bets and \$-bets as fixed effects} ($BF\textsubscript{10} > 1,000$).

%To test also for recency or primacy effects, we compared how well the first half and the second half of the sample sequence in each trial predicts valuations. A linear model $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{0}$ that predicts valuations as a function of the random factor gamble (1--6) outperforms model $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{1}$, which also includes the mean of the first half of the observed samples as a fixed factor ($BF\textsubscript{01} = 16.6$) and model $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{2}$, which includes the mean of the second half of observed samples ($BF\textsubscript{02} = 6.7$). In summary, our analysis did not provide evidence for recency or primacy effects.

% \subsubsection{Confidence ratings}
% Participants' mean confidence ratings of their valuations from experience in the extra small, small, medium, and large sample-size categories were xs = $4.11$ ($SD = 1.10$); s = $4.15$ ($SD = 1.04$); m = $4.14$ ($SD = 1.03$); and l = $4.16$ ($SD = 1.06$). Sample size did not influence participants' confidence systematically: $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{0}$, which predicts confidence rating as a function of a random participant effect, was strongly preferred over $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{1}$, which in addition includes the sample-size category as a predictor ($BF\textsubscript{01} = 737$).

% Because only the BVU model predicts increasing confidence ratings as a function of sample size, we repeated the previous analysis separately for Bayesian and frequentist learners.
% \textcolor{blue}{When considering only those data sets that were best described by the BVU model, confidence was lowest for extra small sample sizes (mean confidence ratings: xs = $3.90$, $SD = 1.03$; s = $4.06$, $SD = 0.91$; m = $4.04$, $SD = 0.93$; l = $4.06$, $SD = 0.97$). However, the simpler model that predicts no influence of sample size was slightly preferred over the model that predicts an effect of sample size ($BF\textsubscript{01} = 3.1$).}
% %OLD:(mean confidence ratings: xs = $3.87$, $SD = 1.05$; s = $4.05$, $SD = 0.94$; m = $4.03$, $SD = 0.94$; l = $4.09$, $SD = 0.96$; $BF\textsubscript{10} = 2.94$). 
% The analysis of those participants who were quantitatively and qualitatively best described by the RF model \textcolor{blue}{also} did not show an effect of sample size on confidence ratings \textcolor{blue}{(mean confidence ratings: xs = $4.45$, $SD = 1.22$; s = $4.37$, $SD = 1.2$; m = $4.35$, $SD = 1.17$; l = $4.35$, $SD = 1.21$; $BF\textsubscript{01} = 108$)}.


\subsubsection{Description versus experience}
Table \ref{table:meansStudy2} displays the mean and median valuations from description. It also shows the difference between the mean valuations in the experience and description conditions (column D--E, separately for different sample sizes). Further, it provides the Bayes factors, quantifying the evidence in favor of a difference between valuations from experience and those from description.

%\begin{center} --- Insert Table \ref{table:meansStudy2} here ---- \end{center}

Valuations made from description and experience differed for most of the gambles and sample sizes (see Table \ref{table:meansStudy2}, rightmost column). In particular, participants attached a higher value to experienced than to described \$-bets (Gambles 1--3) but attached a higher value to described than to experienced p-bets (Gambles 4--6). Thus, we found a D--E gap that is the opposite of the classic D--E gap observed in choice paradigms. In our study, participants valued gambles as if they overweighted rare events from description \textit{and} experience. This effect was even stronger when people made valuations from experience.


We also compared participants' confidence ratings of valuations from experience in each sample-size category to those from description ($M = 4.04$, $SD = 1.08$). Separately for each sample-size category, we compared $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{0}$, which predicts confidence as a function of random participant effects, with $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{1}$, which takes condition as an additional fixed factor into account. The analyses suggest that participants were slightly more confident about their ratings from experience than from description for small ($BF\textsubscript{10} = 2.5$), medium ($BF\textsubscript{10} = 1.3$), and large ($BF\textsubscript{10} = 4.8$) sample sizes. For the extra small sample sizes ($BF\textsubscript{10} = 0.3$), confidence judgments did not differ. 


\subsection{Discussion of Study 1}

Study 1 shows that the size of the sample overall did not have an effect on valuations from experience. \added[id=jj]{Cognitive modeling revealed that the majority of participants followed Bayesian principles and treat sample size as a measure of uncertainty. A minority of participants used a relative frequency strategy and disregarded sample size. Qualitatively, the observed valuations of participants best-fit by the relative-frequency model differed from the valuations of participants that were best described by the BVU model (Figure \ref{fig:qual1}).}

Valuations also differed when made from description versus experience. Interestingly, this difference is the opposite of the classic D--E gap that has been reported in choice paradigms: We found evidence that people behaved as if they overweighted rare events when making valuations from description \textit{and} experience. Notably, this overweighting of rare events was even stronger for the experience condition. Importantly, people assigned higher valuations to \$-bets (i.e., gambles that provide a high reward with low probability) than p-bets (i.e., gambles that provide a small reward with low probability) even when both gambles had similar expected values. This finding is in line with recent research that suggested people overweight extreme outcomes in experience-based tasks \citep{Ludvig2017}.

We found that participants' confidence in their valuations was generally high  ($M = 4.12$, $SD = 1.06$ on a 7-point scale from 0 to 6). \added[id=jj]{However, participants indicated no increase in confidence with growing sample sizes.} If there was any trend, it seemed that confidence decreased with growing sample size, in line with \cite{Griffin1992}. Further, we found evidence that people were more confident in their valuations from experience than their valuations from description.


\section{Study 2}
In Study 1, participants knew the outcomes before drawing samples. This differs from typical studies on decisions from experience, in which people learn the value of the outcomes while sampling. To bring our method more in line with other studies, in Study 2 we changed the experimental method such that one outcome had to be learned during sampling.

\subsection{Methods}
The procedure an methods of Study~2 were similar to Study~1. The only difference consisted in that before participants started sampling, they were now only informed about gambles being two-outcome gambles and that one of the outcomes was zero. Unlike in Study 1, the gain amounts of the gambles were not displayed on screen before or during the sampling stage.

Forty people (38 women, 2 men) between 18 and 27 years old ($M = 21.1$ years, $SD = 2.05$), recruited from the subject pool of the University of Basel, participated. We followed the incentive scheme of Study 1. On average, participants earned a bonus of 7.16 CHF ($SD = 6.91$ at the time of the study). For the data analysis, we compared the same statistical models as described in Study 1.

\subsection{Results}
All analyses were conducted in the statistical programming environment R, models were fit as in the analyses in Study 1.

% \subsubsection{Sample size}
% Table \ref{table:meansStudy3} displays mean and median valuations per gamble and sample-size category. Similar to in Study 1, mean valuations did not differ much between sample sizes: Again, valuations were best predicted by the random factor expected value and the fixed factor gamble type (additional fixed factor sample size: $BF\textsubscript{01} = 285$; additional interaction between sample size and gamble type: $BF\textsubscript{01} > 1,000 $).

% As in Study 1, we examined the data qualitatively. In Figure \ref{fig:ind.fits2}, participants' valuations are plotted against the predicted valuations of the best fitting model given the optimal parameter estimates for each individual. Again the predictions capture the data well. Figure \ref{fig:qual2} shows the mean valuations of the frequentist and Bayesian learners separately for \$-bets and p-bets. Again, the two groups differed. 
% For \$-bets, valuations of frequentist learners seem on average to slightly increase with growing sample size. This observation contrasts with the model predictions yet is statistically not reliable ($BF\textsubscript{01} = 1.5$).  As expected, for p-bets, average valuations of frequentist learners remain stable ($BF\textsubscript{01} = 89$). For \$-bets, valuations of Bayesian learners change  with growing sample size. Yet, this effect is less pronounced than in Study 1 and for both groups statistically not reliable, which again may be related to the small number of participants falling into each group (increasing: $BF\textsubscript{01} = 33$, decreasing: $BF\textsubscript{01} = 59$). For p-bets, valuations of Bayesian learners with uniform, bimodal, and loss priors clearly increase as predicted by the BVU model ($BF\textsubscript{10} > 1,000$).
% Valuations of Bayesian learners with gain priors do not vary systematically with sample size ($BF\textsubscript{01} = 7$). This observation needs to be examined with caution as only three participants fall into this group.

% \subsubsection{Effect of gamble type and sampling order}
% In line with Study 1, the mean and median ratings in Table \ref{table:meansStudy3} show higher valuations for \$-bets (Gambles 1--3) than for p-bets (Gambles 4--6)  even if the gambles had the same expected value (BF\textsubscript{10} \textgreater 1,000). We did not find evidence for any recency or primacy effects. $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{0}$, which predicts valuations as a function of the factor gamble (1--6), was slightly preferred over models that also include the mean of the first half of the observed samples ($\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{1}$) or the mean of the second half of the observed samples ($\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{2}$) as predictors ($BF\textsubscript{01} = 3.4$, $BF\textsubscript{02} = 1.9$). 

% \subsubsection{Confidence ratings}
% The mean confidence ratings in the extra small, small, medium, and large sample-size categories were xs = 4.01 ($SD = 1.23$); s = 4.09, ($SD = 1.14$); m = 4.04 ($SD = 1.19)$; and l = 4.16 ($SD = 1.19$). $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{0}$, which predicts confidence rating as a function of just a random participant effect, was again preferred over a model that also includes sample-size category as predictor ($BF\textsubscript{01} = 11.2$). 

% Considering only those data sets that were best described by the BVU model, mean confidence ratings descriptively increased as a function of  sample size (mean confidence ratings: xs = $3.87$, $SD = 1.27$; s = $3.91$, $SD = 1.15$; m = $3.93$, $SD = 1.13$; l = $4$, $SD = 1.24$). %xs = $3.84$, $SD = 1.31$; s = $3.95$, $SD = 1.16$; m = $4.02$, $SD = 1.13$; l = $4.1$, $SD = 1.28$).
% However, this finding was not reliable as the simpler model that predicts no influence of sample size was still preferred over the model that predicts an effect of sample size ($BF\textsubscript{01} = 77$). Similar to in Study 1, the data sets that were quantitatively and qualitatively best described by the RF model did not show an effect of sample size (mean confidence ratings: xs = $4.05$, $SD = 1.19$; s = $4.17$, $SD = 1.1$; m = $4.06$, $SD = 1.22$; l = $4.19$, $SD = 1.14$; $BF\textsubscript{01} = 45$).


% %xs = $4.04$, $SD = 1.19$; s = $4.14$, $SD = 1.09$; m = $4.02$, $SD = 1.21$; l = $4.13$, $SD = 1.13$; $BF\textsubscript{01} = 72$).
% \subsubsection{Description versus experience}

% Table \ref{table:meansStudy3} displays the mean and median valuations from experience and from description. It also shows the difference between the mean valuations in the experience and description conditions (column D--E, separately for different sample sizes). 

% In line with Study 1, valuations made from experience and description differed. Participants valued experienced \$-bets higher than described \$-bets. In contrast, participants valued described p-bets higher than experienced p-bets. These observations are again in line with the assumption that the probabilities of rare events were overweighted in both conditions, and that this effect was more pronounced for valuations from experience.

% Similar to in Study 1, the Bayes factors (rightmost column of Table \ref{table:meansStudy3}) generally suggest a difference between description and experience. However, the finding is, especially for p-bets, less pronounced than in Study 1. Again, the gap is in contrast to the classic D--E gap reported in the decision-making literature.

% Participants' mean confidence in valuations from description was 3.99 ($SD = 1.12$). Only for large sample sizes were participants more confident about their valuations from experience than they were about valuations from description ($BF\textsubscript{10} = 53$). There is no evidence for this effect for extra small ($BF\textsubscript{10} = 0.1$), small ($BF\textsubscript{10} = 0.7$), or medium ($BF\textsubscript{10} = 0.1$) sample sizes.


\subsection{Discussion of Study 2}
Study 2 tested whether the results of Study 1 are generalizable to typical sampling paradigms where people have to learn the outcome values from experience. The results of Studies 1 and 2 are remarkably similar: Participants behaved as if they overweighted rare events, when making valuations from both experience and description. In line with Study 1, we found that people could be classified as Bayesian and frequentist learners.

\section{General Discussion}
\added[id=jj]{A number of studies have shown that the amount of experience with the outcome distribution of risky prospects affects risk preferences and risky choice. We manipulated the amount of experience (sample size) with risky options in order to investigate specifically, how the sample size influences risk preferences and preference formation in the gain domain.}

\added[id=jj]{Study 1 consisted of an experience-based sampling task in which participants were informed about the outcomes of two binary risky options and had to learn about the probabilities through sampling from the options, designed to examine the effect of variation in sample sizes on people's evaluation of risky gambles after sampling.  To this end we manipulated the sample sizes participants drew within-subjects and held the outcomes of the sampling period representative of the expected value, which allowed us to isolate the effects of sample size on judgments controlling for the effect of sampling error. We tested if participants follow a relative frequency (RF) strategy or Bayesian value updating (BVU). Most participants' value judgments post sampling were best described by the BVU model with an initial belief in the low outcome being more likely than the high outcome, that was quickly overcome by anti-conservative learning from experience. Only around a quarter of participants were best-described by the RF strategy. Participants' mean evaluations of gambles and their confidence did were not substantially affected by sample sizes.}

\added[id=jj]{Study 2 followed a comparable logic, but in this design, the gamble's outcomes were not known to participants prior to learning but had to be learned as well. Again, the size of the samples that participants drew was manipulated. The results are in line with the first study: while mean evaluations and confidence was largely unaffected by the sample size manipulation, cognitive modeling results showed that a Bayesian strategy described the behavior of the majority of participants well (57\%) and that the learners had an initial belief that low outcomes are more likely than high outcomes but it was overcome fast by anti-conservative learning.}

\added[id=jj]{A minority of participants in both studies was described by a relative frequency strategy, which is in line with previous findings suggesting that people believe in the representativeness of short sequences of outcomes \citep{Griffin1992, Tversky1971}. This finding helps explain why people in experience-based tasks often do not sample much: If people believe that a short sequence of outcomes represents a prospect's outcome distribution comprehensively, they do not need to sample much, as they believe that sampling more will not yield new information. }

\added[id=jj]{Our results suggests a substantial degree of strategy heterogeneity that goes beyond heterogeneity in the number of samples that people draw in experience-based risky choice. It is an open question why some of our participants behaved according to Bayesian principles and others did not, and future research is needed to examining what factors influence whether people behave according to Bayesian principles. One possible candidate that mediates what strategy people use is numerical literacy, which has been shown in previous work to be related to performance in Bayesian reasoning tasks \citep{Brase2017}.}


%This classification is supported by people's confidence judgments: When we analyzed confidence judgments separately for people who were classified as believers in the law of small numbers and Bayesian learners, we found that only Bayesian learners were more confident about their judgments for larger than for smaller samples. 
% Indeed, when we plotted the mean valuations of participants best described by each model, we see that the data qualitatively differ (compare Figure \ref{fig:qual1} and \ref{fig:qual2}). While valuations of people best fit by the Bayesian model change as a function of sample size, valuations of people best fit by the RF model do not change systematically. 

\subsubsection{The role of prior beliefs}
\added[id=jj]{The BVU model assumes that people start sampling with an initial belief about the probabilities of different outcomes. Our data suggest that most Bayesian learners started with a higher prior on the lower outcome, but that the incoming experience quickly overcame the initial beliefs. In contrast to previous work, which has indicated that people are slow Bayesian updaters, we find that people update quicker than optimal Bayesian with a liberal learning rate.}



%Many Bayesian learners (8 of 26, 30\% in Study 1 and 7 of 17, 41\% in Study 2) were best described with the loss prior. A loss prior belief predicts that with growing sample sizes, valuations slightly increase for \$-bets and more strongly increase for p-bets (cf. Figure \ref{fig:sensi}). This prediction is in line with our findings that changes in valuations are more pronounced for \$-bets than for p-bets. A slightly different explanation for the behavior of people best fit with the BVU model and a loss prior is that not sample size but the absolute number of observed gains influences valuations. The more gains people observe and the larger the gains are, the more attractive a gamble may be.  Applied most strictly, this hypothesis would suggest larger increases in valuations with growing sample size for \$-bets than for p-bets, as the gain amount in \$-bets is higher. Future research could test this hypothesis, for instance, by investigating valuations for gambles presented with even larger sample sizes. The Bayesian model predicts that with very large sample sizes, selling prices approach people's true selling prices. However, if the absolute number of gains influences selling prices, selling prices should keep increasing as the absolute observed number of gains increases. %Further, future research should test whether such a hypothesis can explain the valuations of Frequentists learners in Study 2, who --for \$-bets and on the aggregate level-- made higher valuations for larger than smaller sample sizes. 

We have assumed that over the course of the experiment and across different gambles, people's prior beliefs do not change. However, recent research suggests that knowing the gain amount elicits a more informed prior belief about the probability. Under uncertainty, people's beliefs about gain probabilities are informed by the gain amount: Large gains are believed to be less likely than small gains when no other information about a gamble than the gain amount is given \citep{Pleskac2014, Hoffart2018}. If in our studies people indeed used gain amounts as predictors of the probability and integrated this information with their samples, this can explain why we see only a small effect of sample size on gamble valuations. This is because in our experimental design large gains were indeed less likely than small gains. Thus, it corresponded to the probability--reward pattern that people might presuppose. If people start sampling with prior probability beliefs that correspond closely to the real outcome probabilities, new incoming information does not shift probability beliefs as dramatically as when the prior beliefs are uninformed (e.g., uniform priors). Future research could investigate this hypothesis, for instance, by investigation how sample size influences valuations in \textit{nonrepresentative} environments, such as environments where the size of a reward/gain is uncorrelated with the probability that it occurs.

\subsection{Description versus experience in choice and valuation}
\added[id=jj]{Our findings are not in line with the classic description-experience gab, that is our participants did not behave as if they overweight rare events from description and underweight rare events from experience. In our valuation tasks participants behaved as if they overweighted rare events from both description and experience.}

Importantly, in contrast to standard experience-based choice tasks where participants experience two lotteries and make binary choices, our participants had to evaluate one individual gamble in each trial. \cite{Lichtenstein1971}, for instance, report preference reversals when people evaluate rather than chose options (a person who chooses Gamble A over Gamble B may assign a higher value to Gamble B than to Gamble A). Our valuation data is not in line with other work on evaluations from experience, that finds stronger over-weighting of rare events in an experience- than a description-format \citep{Golan2014}, but this design differs from our task in that it did not use representative outcome sequences. As we argued in the Introduction, in free-sampling paradigms, the experienced relative frequencies of outcomes do not necessarily match the underlying probability and the resulting sampling error might have contributed to the difference in the results. It is further conceivable that people show different information processing in free- and forced-sampling paradigms. For instance, people may pay more attention to a voluntarily sampled outcome than to a sampled outcome that resulted from a forced sampling decision.

\subsubsection{Buying versus selling prices}
In our experiments, we assessed preferences by asking people for selling prices for gambles. 
The endowment effect describes that people attach higher value to goods when they sell them than when they buy them \citep{Thaler1980}. \cite{Pachur2012} demonstrated this endowment effect in an experience-based task. It would be interesting to replicate our experiments with buying instead of selling prices and more rigorously compare the results with buying and selling prices from description. However, this was beyond the scope of the present study. Here, our main focus was to investigate whether preferences are influenced by sample sizes. This question can be answered independently of response format. Irrespective of whether people are asked for selling prices or buying prices or make repeated choices, the Bayesian model predicts an effect of sample size on valuations. 

\subsubsection{Confidence in valuations from description and experience}
People were more confident with their gamble valuations from experience than from description. This finding is remarkable given that from a normative perspective one could argue that people feel more confident when making valuations from description than when making valuations from experience. This is because valuations from description do not entail any uncertainty about the outcome distributions, whereas valuations from experience may entail such uncertainty.

Our findings do support research by \cite{Bradbury2014}. They reported that people who made investment decisions in the laboratory felt better informed and were more confident about their decisions from experience than those from description.
Potentially, people perceive and process experienced information differently from described information \citep{Kahneman2009}: 
While information that is described is more abstract, experienced information has direct salience or impact. When people draw a sample, they not only observe the outcome but also experience emotional reactions resulting from that observation. Thus, people do not only learn plain facts about the outcome distribution; they also gain a more vivid understanding of this distribution. This more concrete understanding of the gamble can help people access their preferences and thus creates higher confidence in valuations.



%\subsection{Conclusion}
%In this study, we investigated how people form  preferences from experience. Our results offer a new perspective on the finding that people sample very little when forming preferences from experience: A substantial proportion of people appear to believe in the law of small numbers; that is, their valuations do not change as a function of sample size.
