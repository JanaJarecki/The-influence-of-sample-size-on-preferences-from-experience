<!-- For all analyses we used the software R \citep{R2019}. For the linear model comparisons, we used the BayesFactor package \citep{BayesFactor}. We based our inferences on the Bayes factor ($BF\textsubscript{ij}$), which quantifies how much more or less likely the data are under Model i ($\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{i}$) than Model j ($\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{j}$). A Bayes factor of 1 ($BF\textsubscript{ij} = 1$) means that the data do not discriminate between the two models $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{i}$ and $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{j}$. A Bayes factor of 5 (i.e., $BF\textsubscript{ij} = 5$) means that the data are 5 times more likely under $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{i}$ than under $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{j}$. A Bayes factor of $1/5$ ($BF\textsubscript{ij} = 1/5$) means that the data are 5 times more likely under $\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{j}$ (note that $BF\textsubscript{ji} = 1/BF\textsubscript{ij}$).
