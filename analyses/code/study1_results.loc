\ChangesListline {added}{Added}{The observed and predicted evaluations were normalized to a common range (0 - 1, by division through the gain magnitude and truncation of normalized values $>$ 1). The free model parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood at the participant level, assuming observations follow a truncated normal distribution (truncation: 0-1) around the model predictions with a constant standard deviation ($\sigma $) estimated as a free parameter ($0 < \sigma \leq 1$). Therefore, the RF model had 2 free parameter, the power utility exponent $\alpha $ ($0 \leq \alpha \leq 20$) and $\sigma $. The BVU model had 4 free parameter the gain prior $\theta _G$ ($0 \leq \theta _G \leq 1$; the loss prior was $\theta _0=2-\theta _G$), the learning rate $\delta $ ($0 \leq \delta \leq 10$), $\alpha $ and $\sigma $. A 3-parameter BVU model was also tested, constraining the BVU to have a fixed learning rate of $\delta =1$ (optimal Bayesian updating). The baseline model had 2 free parameter, the mean evaluation $\mu $ and $\sigma $. Parameters were estimated by a local nonlinear optimization solver solnp using the R package solnp (REF). The model comparison used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), transformed into Bayesian evidence weights (\citealp {Kass1995, Lewandowsky2011}).}{3}
