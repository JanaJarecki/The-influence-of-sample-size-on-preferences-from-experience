\subsubsection{Evaluations of gambles and sample sizes}

Table \ref{tab:means_study1} summarizes the evaluations of the gambles
by format (description vs.~experience) and sample size (xs, s, m, l).
For instance, across sample sizes xs, s, m, and l, our participants
evaluated gamble 4 with an average of \(2.80, 2.91, 2.80, 2.95, 3.08\)
(respectively). Across gambles, the evaluations were not influenced by
sample sizes, which a model comparison among analyses of variance
(ANOVA) of the judgments confirmed: an ANOVA with the predictors gamble
type and gamble expected value (Model 0) outperformed models with the
additional predictors sample size (\(BF_{01} = 445\)) and a sample-size
x gamble-type interaction (\(BF_{02} > 1000\), all models had
by-participant random effects). The \$-bet gambles were evaluated higher
(\(M=5.78, SD=3.94\)) than the p-bet gambles (\(M=2.74, SD=1.09\)),
although the \$-bets and p-bets had the same expected values,
\(BF > 1000\) in favor of an ANOVA that predicts evaluations as a
function of gamble type over an ANOVA without the predictor gamble type
(both models include by-participant and by-expected-value random
effects).

The evaluations in the experience condition were not driven by primacy
or recency: neither the outcomes that participants sampled in the first
half of the sampling phase nor those sampled during the second half of
said phase predict the observed evaluations. A linear model of the
evaluations with the predictor gamble type
(\(\mathrm{M}\textsubscript{0}\)) outperformed a model with the
additional predictor mean of the first half of samples
(\(BF\textsubscript{01} = 16.6\)) and a model with the additional
predictor mean of the second half of samples
(\(BF\textsubscript{02} = 6.7\))

\textit{Description versus experience.} Participants' valuations from
description and experience differed for most of the gambles and sample
sizes (Table \ref{tab:means_study1}, rightmost column). The \$-bets were
evaluated higher based on experience (\(M=5.78, SD=3.94\)) compared to
description (\(M=4.93, SD=3.45\)). By contrast p-bets were evaluated
lower from experience (\(M=2.74, SD=1.09\)) compared to description
(\(M=2.86, SD=0.98\)), \(BF > 1000\) in favor of an ANOVA including a
gamble-type x condition interaction over a model with only the main
effects. Thus, we found a D--E gap that differs from the classic D--E
gap observed in choice paradigms. In our study, participants valued
gambles as if they overweighted rare events from description
\textit{and} experience. This effect was even stronger when people made
valuations from experience.

At the aggregate level, sample size seems to not influence the
evaluations of gambles in our decision from experience paradigm, but the
subsequent cognitive modeling analyses will show a more nuanced picture.

\subsubsection{Cognitive modeling}

We used computational modeling to analyze the role of sample size in
value judgments more closely, comparing the performance of the
\added[id=jj]{relative frequency} (RF) model and the
\added[id=jj]{Bayesian value updating} (BVU) model.
\added[id=jj]{The models were compared to a baseline model, which predicts a constant evaluation equal to the mean individual evaluation (sensible models are expected to outperform this baseline model).}

\textit{Modeling Procedure.} To fit the model parameters, the observed
and predicted evaluations were normalized to a common range between 0
and 1 (by division through the gain of the presented gamble). Maximum
likelihood was used to estimate the free model parameters at the
participant level, assuming that observations follow a truncated normal
distribution around the model predictions (truncation between 0 and 1)
with a constant standard deviation (\(\sigma\)), that was estimated by
participant (\(0 < \sigma \leq 1\)).
\added[id=jj]{Therefore, the relative frequency model had two free parameters, namely $\sigma$ and the power utility exponent $\alpha$ ($0 \leq \alpha \leq 20$). The Bayesian value updating model had four free parameters, the gain prior $\theta_G$ ($0 \leq \theta_G \leq 2$), the learning rate $\delta$ ($0 \leq \delta \leq 10$), $\alpha$ and $\sigma$, with the prior on zero outcomes constrained to $\theta_0=2-\theta_G$. The baseline model had two free parameters, the mean evaluation $\mu$ and $\sigma$. We estimated the parameters using an augmented Lagrange multiplier method \citep[Rsolnp package, version 1.16]{Ghalanos2015}. Models were compared based on evidence strength and BIC weights from the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) \cite[evidence in favor of a model compared to the individually best-fitting model][]{Kass1995, Lewandowsky2011}. Higher weights indicate stronger evidence for a model.}

We will first outline the quantitative model fit, followed by the
qualitative model fit, and lastly analyze the effects of sample size
given the cognitive strategies.

\textit{Quantitative Model Fit.}
\added[id=jj]{The Bayesian value updating model described the majority of the participants best (30 of 40; 75\%). The relative frequency model described 9 participants best (22\%); the baseline model described 1 participants best. Figure \ref{fig:fig2} shows the evidence strength for the models by participant. The models' mean Bayesian information criterion across all participants equaled BIC\textsubscript{BVU}$= -124$, BIC\textsubscript{RF}$= -110$, and BIC\textsubscript{BASE}$= -17$ (lower values indicate better fit).}

\end{figure}

\added[id=jj]{
The estimated parameter of the best-fitting models, which Table \ref{tab:study1_parameter} summarizes, reveal that the power utility exponent ($\alpha$) did not differ for the participants that were described by a Bayesian value updating strategy ($M_{\alpha}= 1.49$) and those using a relative frequency strategy ($M_{\alpha}=1.61$), $\Delta$ $M = -0.08$ 95\% HDI $[-0.97$, $0.76]$, $\mathrm{BF}_{\textrm{01}} = 2.76$. Participants using the Bayesian strategy had, on average, a prior belief that gains occur with 46\% (gain prior $\theta_G = 0.92$; zero-outcome prior $\theta_0 = 1.08$). Also, their estimated learning rate $\delta$ was anti-conservative ($M_{\delta}=1.36$; values $>$ 1 are liberal, 1 is optimal Bayesian, $<$ 1 is conservative learning). The liberal learning rate is unusual given that previous work has found conservative learning \citep{Edwards1967,Tauber2017}. The liberal learning in our data can be explained by that participants repeatedly sampled from the same set of gambles.

\end{table}

\textit{Qualitative Model Fit.} The qualitative fit between the models
and the data is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig5}, which plots the
predictions of the best-fitting models against the observed evaluations
by participant. The models generally describe the data well
\added[id=jj]{($M r\textsubscript{pred,obs} = 0.71$), except in four cases, where even the winning model fails to resemble the data qualitatively (participants s05, s19, s24, s38, with $r\textsubscript{pred,obs} < 0.40$).}
For these cases, for whom the winning model is the Bayesian updating
model, the model must be rejected because of qualitative
mis-fit.\footnote{As robustness check we repeated the model comparison with subjective probability weighting, using Prelec’s single parameter weighting function. This weighting function incorporates non-linearities in the perception of probabilities. However, the quantitative results of the probability weighting model and the utility model, we favored a utility model without probability weighting.}

\end{figure}

\added[id=jj]{
The cognitive modeling results thus show that most participants were described by a Bayesian strategy, and a minority by a relative-frequency strategy. This strategy heterogeneity helps understanding the behavioral null finding---that sample size seemed to have no effect on valuations---that were observed at the aggregate level (Table \ref{tab:means_study1}). The aggregate analysis fails to take the individual differences in learning strategies into account, while participants are best described by a mixture of strategies. Moreover, the aggregate analysis also fails to account for differences in the prior beliefs about gain probabilities.
